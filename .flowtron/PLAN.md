# Pidly — PLAN.md

## Vision

Pidly is a native macOS menu bar app (Swift + SwiftUI, M-series) that scans for stray and zombie processes — orphaned test runners, playwright-mcp instances, zombie Chrome helpers — and surfaces them with a badge count. One click expands a tray UI with categorised candidates, kill buttons for safe ones, and a "needs review" section for anything tied to a registered port or recently started. The goal is to replace the manual `ps aux | grep` ritual with a permanent, low-friction process hygiene tool that lives beside the clock.

See [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) for the canonical workflow contract.

- [ ] **PID-EPIC-15** [light]🔧 | doc-sync — SPEC.md divergences + tasknote README quick commands. Discovery supplied by audit-repo 2026-06-24. Surfaced by audit-repo 2026-06-24 (Theme: Spec-Code Drift).
  - [ ] **PID-15.2** [light]🔧 | spec-settings — fix `Settings.swift` → `SettingsView.swift` in SPEC project structure table; update JSON override claim (move to Future Opportunities or implement)
  - [ ] **PID-15.3** [light]🔧 | tasknote-readme-cmds — replace generic Quick Commands stub with correct xcodebuild invocations; document `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` requirement for CLI test runs

## Future Opportunities

- XPC service / `launchd` plist for background scanning (no app in foreground required)
- Docker / container management panel
- JSON override file for port registry (user-editable, loaded at startup)
- Animated icon states beyond simple badge
