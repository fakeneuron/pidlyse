# Pidly — PLAN.md

## Vision

Pidly is a native macOS menu bar app (Swift + SwiftUI, M-series) that scans for stray and zombie processes — orphaned test runners, playwright-mcp instances, zombie Chrome helpers — and surfaces them with a badge count. One click expands a tray UI with categorised candidates, kill buttons for safe ones, and a "needs review" section for anything tied to a registered port or recently started. The goal is to replace the manual `ps aux | grep` ritual with a permanent, low-friction process hygiene tool that lives beside the clock.

See [`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) for the canonical workflow contract.

## Future Opportunities

- XPC service / `launchd` plist for background scanning (no app in foreground required)
- Docker / container management panel
- JSON override file for port registry (user-editable, loaded at startup) — also resolves the manual-sync burden flagged in audit-repo 2026-06-24
- Animated icon states beyond simple badge
- TTY sentinel single-source-of-truth: extract `ProcessItem.isTTYAttached(_:)` helper, call from `ScanEngine.makeItem` to eliminate dual-site sentinel set
